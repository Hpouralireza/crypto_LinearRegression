# crypto_LinearRegression
Using LinearRegression and Train_test_split in the Bitcoin (BTC) dataset to predict past and future prices

#

First, we download the desired dataset from the Yahoo Finance, Kaggle or etc,
Then we check the parameters of the created dataframe and after that, we clean the data.

We divide the data into two parts, train & test, and give it to the train_test_split algorithm
Then, with using the obtained values, use the Linear Regression algorithm

Then we will shift 30 days forward
